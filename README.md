FoxPost is my blog, its written in rust and uses postgres as a db. As much as possible is done on the backend with a minimal amount done in the frontend. Posts are written in markdown and rendered using pulldown-cmark as html. Currently moving towards more configureable behvaior

Probably not production ready
